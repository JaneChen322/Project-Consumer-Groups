accele_file_convert.py
        This Python file is used to convert the old log files of acceleration to the latest log files with new
    acceleration data format.

        Noticed that the old log files have data format as following:
            person_id, time_step_window, acceleration
        Each old file contains all records of all people in exact one experiment.
        The old file name is like "data2_1.csv" in which the first digit "2" denotes the id of experiment while the
    second means that it is the acceleration data that are stored in the file.

        And the new log files have data format like this:
            time_step_window, acceleration_in_x, acceleration_in_y, acceleration_in_z
        Each new type file contains all records of one person in one experiment.
        The name of this kind of file is like "2.1_accele.csv" in which digit "2" denotes the experiment id and the
    other digit "1" denotes the person id.

        The old log files need to be placed in the directory "input" which is in the same directory with this Python
    file. And the output files will be output into the directory "output" which is also in the same directory with this
    Python file.


dbad.py
        TYPEFEATURE = 1 means that acceleration data will be processed.
        TYPEFEATURE = 2 means that orientation data will be processed.
        TYPEFEATURE = 3 means that acceleration data will be processed and Mclust will be used during processing.

        对于TYPEFEATURE = 3，程序中使用的函数为jdFuncForMclust。该函数的一个type参数表示，值为1则使用最初的Mclust积分方法，值为2使用
    参考了jdGaaussian函数的优化积分方法，值为3将使用包含蒙特卡罗积分的Mclust方法。

        LENWINDOW对于TYPEFEATURE=1，使用15，对于TYPEFEATURE=2，至少使用5。
        LENFILTER对于TYPEFEATURE=1使用1，对于TYPEFEATURE=2，要使用最优的值。
        实际上，LENFILTER=1表明不使用平滑操作。在TYPEFEATURE=3时，若想使用平化操作，可将LENFILTER的值设定为大于1的一个最优值。
